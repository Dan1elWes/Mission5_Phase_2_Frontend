# Mission 5 Phase 2 - Frontend

## Project Overview
This is Version 1 of our application based on the prototype design from UX Designers in Phase 1. The application is built as part of a team project where each developer is responsible for implementing at least one screen with both frontend and backend functionality.

## Features
- MongoDB integration for data persistence
- React-based frontend with modern UI components
- Shared common components across developers
- Screen-based development approach

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Backend server running (see backend README)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Create a `.env` file with necessary environment variables
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Development Guidelines
- Each developer works on at least one complete screen
- Screens include both frontend UI and backend integration
- Use shared components for consistency
- Follow the established Git workflow for collaboration

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code directory
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
